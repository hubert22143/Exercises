Today I've learned about emmet syntaxes as well as some usefull cheat sites
https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/
https://htmlcheatsheet.com/css/
I've learned that, we can improve our type speed in html drastically, by using emmet syntaxes. Emmet syntaxes are built-in extension, in the VS code, which allows us
to create the elements way faster.
The example for implementation emmet syntaxes is following if we wish to create div, which contains 3 p elements, with their own class:
syntax > is saying that, the p element is the child of div. So basically the div contains 3 p elements as we wish.
syntax $ describes the item numbering, from 1 to x
syntax * describe exactly what you think it's doing, it simply works as multiplier, we want it to contain 3 elements, so we're multyplying by 3.
div>p.class$*3
